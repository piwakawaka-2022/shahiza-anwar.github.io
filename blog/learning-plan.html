      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>At the moment my focus is to keep learning and get better at coding.
           My long term goal would be to be able to look back and feel proud of where 
           I got to due to my hard work and persistence. I want to see myself being able 
           to do my job easily and have also expanded my knowledge in programming. 
         </p>
         <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
      <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
      <p>persistence - this is a motivational factor for me to work through the challenges 
          and obstacles I’m facing when introduced to something new in my learning.
           This helps me stick to my goal. For example if I feel stuck, I make an effort to 
           get the answers I need in order to move on.</p>
      <p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
      <p>Not able to express myself openly is my limitation - I struggle sometimes opening 
          up to seek help. I can feel quite intimidated when I’m around people who are more 
          experienced and knowledgeable than me. However, I know I will not progress or get answers if I don’t ask questions and get the help I need.
        self doubt my abilities- I often doubt myself when I’m relatively new at something. 
        For instance, If I’m behind in a project than others,This makes me question my abilities 
        and I compare myself with others. To overcome this limitation, I convince myself that I 
        have got to where I’am because of my ability and I don’t have to be on the same pace as 
        others. </p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>I am very shy and reserved person and so I don’t open up easily to others. I would like to work on the communication aspect
            As it is an important factor for developers to work together in order to deliver
             successful product. Working and communicating with diverse group of people at Dev 
             Academy will be so helpful in developing strong communication skills.</p>
             <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
             <p>Avoid multi tasking and focus on one thing at a time - because I’m learning new things, 
                 I take step by step rather than overwhelming myself with too much information all at once.</p>
             </p>  To avoid burning out, I have to balance my studies and life. 
                This involves avoiding facing the computer for long hours and take breaks every 1 hour even 
                if its for 15mins.</p>
               <p>Self care is also essential part during intense learning period. I take out time to go for
                a walk with my baby, making sure I’m eating well and hydrated in between so I’m more effective at what I’m doing. 
               When I feel myself getting stressed out, I remind myself that I need to be easy on myself, 
               take a break, and then start it again. If I feel stuck then I will make sure to also ask for 
               help from other members and facilitators. This way I won’t be over thinking and spending too 
               much time than required on a certain thing.</p>
               <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
               <p>My first approach is to seek answers myself. This includes reflecting back on my
                   e resources, google to find solutions. However, if I know I am spending too much time 
                   on it and not progressing then I would seek help on slack. I will take the advise from 
                   w colleague. Also, I will refer to my facilitator for guidance.</p>
                   <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
                   <p>I would like my facilitation team to help guide me through this journey and 
                        an inclusive environment. To have open conversation with each other, giving 
                        honest opinions and comments about my work. Also, giving me honest advise and 
                        ways to improve my work.</p>
            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
                 For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s 
                 important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>My family understands that I need to prioritise and give most of my time towards this course.
                 I do have a 9 month old baby and she is well looked after by my family. I just attend her when 
                 I am needed </p>
