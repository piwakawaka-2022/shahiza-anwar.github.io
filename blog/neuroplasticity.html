    <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
    
    <p>Neuroplasticity also known as brain plasticity refers to the brains ability to change, grow and adapt in response to 
        the interactions with our environment. It gives us the capability to store and process a lot of information and also the
         ability to accomodate to initiate changes within and outside of our bodies. It is important for increasing our knowledge.
         Basically, the more you exercise your brain, the stronger it becomes. It begins by engaging in something that is important and challenging to you. You focus and commit to it as frequently as you can. 
       </p>
    <p>Repeatedly practicing an activity or accessing a memory makes group of neurons in your brain to shape themselves accordingly. 
        In comparison to the neurons that are rarely or never used will eventually die. 
      </p>
    <p>
        Engaging with these principles will benefit me in learning new things such as learning how to code which I have never done before.
        One of the ways for me to increase my neuroplasticity is having the clarity on what I want to achieve first. This will drive me 
        towards that direction and its related to my values and identity that I discussed in my previous blog. Persistence is really the 
        key motivating factor for me to move towards learning something completely new such as coding. 
    </p>
    
        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            Growth mindset  refers to believing in yourself to be able to increase your capacity to learn anything with effort 
            and persistence.With a growth mindset, you will have a desire to learn which means you will work hard towards your goal 
            and will be more successful in life. When you think this way, you will not let any hurdles or challenges holding you back. 
            Instead, you take this positively and see a way for growth and learning. In contrast , someone with fixed mindset believes 
            they have the talent, intelligence or abilities already and it can’t be changed. This can prevent growth and development in life.
        </p>
        <p>
            After exploring about Growth Mindset, I have decided to believe in myself and not to self doubt my abilities. 
            I will also see the challenges as an opportunity to improve myself and learn from it. In order to integrate growth mindset 
            into my learning journey, I will first bring confidence in myself to get out of my comfort zone. Be open to explore and
             learn new things. If I know I’m stuck or failing at something, just need to regain focus and remind myself that this is 
             all part of the learning process.
        </p>
       
        <h3>How Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset influences my Learning plan and strategy</h3>
        <p>
            Understanding how neuroplasticity and growth mindset works, it has definitely given me an encouragement and 
            self belief in myself that you can learn anything if you put your mind and effort into it. Its very clear with 
            these concepts that the more I practice something new such as learning programming for instance, the more our brain
             will adapt to carrying it out properly which leads to being successful in gaining this new skill set. Through this process,
              it’s very important that I  have a strong growth mindset as that’s the driving factor and a form of motivation for me to 
              reach my goal when things are challenging. I am going to be open to challenges and intend to learn and practice everyday.
               I will not be aiming for perfection but as long as I make an effort and exploring things outside of my comfort zone, 
               this way I will be developing my own personal growth and in my course too.
        </p> 
       <p> One of the best resource that I came across is this site <a href="https://www.mybestself101.org/neuroplasticity">Personal Growth</a> that explained neuroplasticity and growth mindset so well, definitely a good read.
