    <h2>Identity and Values </h2>
    <div class="box">
   
    <p>While looking at this question related to my identity and values, 
        I spent hours trying to figure out about myself as what defines me, 
        what do I value and I figured out a lot about myself while thinking this through.</p>
    
            <p>The two ways I associate to define my identity: Reflection and sharing
                sharing: which means I share my thoughts, choices I make, any situations 
                that is on my mind, with people I am close with. This way I get honest opinion 
                from others, I hear myself think and acknowledge the positive or differences.
                Reflection:I take out time to sit down and reflect back on the choices I make 
                and how it affects my life. This way I learn so many things about myself.
                This process of sharing and reflection helps me to identify myself not just 
                through my own perception but also by how others define us.</p>
                    <p>My family culture has been a major factor in shaping my identity and thus the values I possess.
                         This has been passed on to me since childhood and the way I have been raised.
                          Growing up in a traditional muslim family and at the same time exposed to western
                           society has given me an outlook on file and my identity.
         Growing up, my parents have always taught me what is right and wrong,
         good and bad. This has. Made me feel safe, protected, to be kind and 
         honest. Seeing my parents work hard from the beginning in Fiji and until
         we got to New Zealand to give us kids the better life. This has been my
         inspiration and the values I have inherited just by seeing them. My parents
         have always focused on values such as honestly, respect, hard work and the decisions 
         we make that doesn’t hurt others. This has been a big influence in me making everyday 
         decisions and choices.
         Core Personal values that are really important to me are:</p>
            
            <p>Confidence - I have been quite confident in some situations but 
            less confidence in many others. Being less confident has made me feel 
            low and disappointed in myself. I was afraid of taking risks. While reflecting back 
            on myself, I have decided to look on the positive side and told myself that taking
             risks and failing is part of the process, this just makes you stronger and you learn 
             to do better. Joining Dev Academy is a great example as someone with no experience in
              coding, I have built up the confidence and decided to take up this challenge. 
              </p>
              <p>Kindness is one of the important core value that defines our character. 
 There is a quote I found few years ago by someone handing out brochures
  “Being kind to others always makes the world feel like a much better place” and since then
   I have never forgotten it. I always believe that treating someone the same way you want to be
    treated is the best way to define your actions. This means even smiling at someone can
     brighten up their day. This also means being kind to yourself. When you hear that negative
      thought in your head which makes you feel down, this is the time to do your best to be kind
       to yourself.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <div class="box">
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    
    <p>Empathy/caring- Being empathetic and caring to other peoples emotions and 
        understanding them gives me happiness. I make sure I’m present for anyone who needs
         my help, listen to them and do my best to be there for them in any way I can. 
         This builds trust, heals and essential for building good relationships.
      </p>
      
          <p>
            Dependability- I see myself as someone who can be relied on. 
            This can be from someone needing help or guidance or trusting me with something.
             When I make promises or say I’m going to do something, 
             I make sure to prioritise that to make it happen
          </p>
      
    <p>
        Determination- Once I set a goal for myself, I use that as my motivation to achieve 
        that goal. Even if that involves me failing or being unsuccessful at times, 
        I push myself and make an effort to get where I have to be.
    </p></div>


<div class="box">
<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>Overwork- When I’m working I try to do as much as I can on the same day that means
     trying to meet deadlines earlier than needed. This way I forget to take my breaks 
     and then it gets too overwhelming for me.</p>
    
         <p>
            Expressing emotions/open up - It is not easy for me to open up about myself to
             people and express how I’m feeling. This way I’m holding it all in. I usually
              hide my feeling to avoid being vulnerable in front of others, sometimes lack of
               confidence or even thinking how others would judge me. This leads to a build up 
               of emotions inside me which is not healthy for my well-being.   
         </p>
         <p>
            Impatient - I like to get things done quickly and this way I end up
             missing out on crucial details. I also rush too quickly in decision 
             making meaning I make wrong choices sometimes. Without looking at all the 
             details properly or knowing the complete story, I jump to conclusions.
              I have realised that when I am impatient, things do not go well for me and I 
              don’t accomplish much.

         <h3>Challenges</h3>
     
     <p>
        In my previous work as a lab technician, I was learning a particular area called 
        sendaways with a colleague who was training me. As well as my work colleague, she
         was also one of my closest friend. During the first couple days, I found the send 
         away process a bit of a challenge but after that, I was able to get the hang of it.
         During our training days, I would be asking her a lot of questions , also I wasn’t on 
         the same pace as her as she was too quick for me so I politely asked her to slow down.
          Later on that day, my team leader who is also closer to my training partner approached
           me about my attitude that I am a bit slow. I felt like my team leader was very biased 
           because she only heard one side of the story and not my side. I talked to my other 
           colleague about it and she felt the same way about my trainer who is also my friend 
           that her working pace is too fast for us to learn. There was a bit of conflict between
            me and my trainer after that. We didn’t  speak for ages because It was hard for me to
             open up to her and tell her where she was wrong. One day I decided to approach her to 
             solve this matter. I kindly told her that in order for me or for anyone to learn, as a
              trainer, she needs to go step by step because you’re not just trying to complete your 
              work but you’re teaching us too. Now, reflecting back I would have defended myself to 
              my team leader and expressed how I felt at that point in time.</p></div>

         <h3>Ethical Decision</h3>
     
     <p>

One ethical decision I had to make was also from my previous job as a case coordinator.
 I had an experience with a clients mother who called and was rude to me on the phone. 
 She was requesting to setup her sons weekly compensation. There was a note on clients file 
 that he is not entitled for any weekly compensation based on the legislation process.
 I repeated it to her but she wouldn’t take no for an answer. However, while looking at her 
 sons file, it seemed like he was entitled to some money but I didnt do anything about it based 
 on the note left by my other colleague. After the call, this was really bothering me and so I 
 decided to go over his application again with my team leader. We found out that there was some 
 missing information and so the client was entitled for weekly compensation. I called the clients 
 mother back and apologised, explained the situation and she understood.
