      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                I have always been a very reserved person and since the start of this course, 
                I have really learnt to start opening up and ask questions
              </li>
              <li>
                One of the main thing I have learnt about myself is believing in my capability. I used to doubt myself a
                 lot and lack of self confidence to try new things.
              </li>
              <li>
                I have learnt to understand my emotions and how I’m feeling. With the certain way I am feeling I am 
                learning to understand it, how to cope with it. This way I am also aware of how other people could  be
                 feeling and how I can be there for them.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

      <p>
        In learning and programming, skills isn’t everything these days is what I have learnt. Empathy is very important as thats 
        what makes you aware and being sensitive to other peoples feelings. This way you identify other peoples problems and able to work together to find a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
        Being self aware is understanding your own self. This includes our personal values and empathy too which drives our behaviours. When you are self aware you learn better on how to interact with others and their feelings, better decision making and much more which leads to positive environment, less stress and a plan for professional and personal development.
       </p>

       <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

       <p>
        I think its learning about growth mindset and neuroplasticity. I used to self doubt myself a lot but after learning about 
        this topic, it has really given me confidence.  
       </p>

       <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

       <p>
        I believe the challenging aspect was to really understand my personal values and what I identify myself with. Prior to this, 
        I never really reflected on my values and so putting it all together was a bit challenging.
       </p>

       <h4>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
            bootcamp course?</h4>

        <p>
            Its not just about coding in the real world as a software developer you need soft skills too. In order to work effectively 
            and provide better outcomes at work, you need to have a high level of awareness, understanding of others and your own self. 
            Core learning is such a big focus before entering a work environment so that way we prepare ourselves on how to work effectively
            ith others, be empathetic to others. It is all about working with others with trust and honesty. It is about believing in yourself 
            and your capability that will give you confidence to never give up in reaching your goal and to keep learning. This is what 
            the employers are looking for, its the attitude.
        </p>

        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
             practise programming instead?</h4>

         <p>
            I think it was so useful spending so much time studying core learning because it really gives me the inner belief in myself 
            and mindset required for this course. It has really changed my attitude towards learning and I am really grateful to be able
             to focus on this aspect of learning and not just tech.
