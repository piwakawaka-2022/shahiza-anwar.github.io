    <h3>HTML vs CSS</h3>
    <p> Lets start with HTML. This stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Lets break this down to what this actually means.
        Hyper Text - means it is a link which contains link within it. Markup Language is basically a computer language to define and 
        clarify elements of a document.  You can see HTML as the structure of the building.</p>
        <p>
            CSS represents Cascading Style Sheets. It is a design language used to style a webpage. This makes the website look attractive 
            than just plain text on a white background. It allows you to add colours, positioning, change fonts, page layouts and much more.
            an see CSS as the design of the building.
        </p>

    <h3>
        Control flow and Loops
    </h3>
    <p>Control flow is a concept in programming that defines the order in which the computer runs its code from top to bottom 
        unless you change its condition or loop. </p>
        <p>Loop is a process used to repeat the same line of codes as long as the conditions are met. For example, 
            you were colouring a book and you need 5 different coloured pens for it (red, green, blue, yellow, purple). 
            You only picked up the red pen from the table to use but then you realise you need green pen and then you turn around to 
            pick that up. There! You just made a loop!. You keep looping around until you have picked up all 5 coloured pens.</p>


    <h3>
        The DOM
    </h3>
    <p>DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that allows you  to make multiple changes to the elements in HTML. 
        It is basically, a representation of the HTML file. DOM can be represented as a tree like structure, which has a tree of objects called nodes,
         HTML being on top of the tree and beneath that Head and Body.</p>
         <img src = "../img/DOM tree.png" alt = "DOM tree" height="320"width="580">

    <h3>
        Arrays and Objects
    </h3>
    <p>
        Array is known as storing large amount of information in one variable. Arrays are within the square brackets [ ] 
        separated by commas in numerical order starting with zero. For example: </p>
    <img src = "../img/array example.png" alt = "Array example" height="320"width="630">
<p>
    Object is known as storing a collection of properties in one variable. A property is in a  “key:value” pair that contains a 
    name (key) and a value where value can be anything. It is within a curly bracket {…} and the keys and values are separated by colons. 
    Information stored inside objects are unordered unlike array as seen earlier. Below is an example:
</p>
<img src = "../img/objects example.png" alt = "Object example" height="320"width="580">




    <h3>
        Functions
    </h3>
    <p>
        A function is a group of code that is used to perform certain tasks. It is designed to be reusable to make programs more 
        efficient. Functions are identified with the function keyword, followed by the function name and parenthesis ()  that contains 
        the parameters(inputs) if any. A function can have either none or more than one parameters that is separated by commas.  
        This is all followed by the curly braces {} which contains the codes within it which will be carried out when we run the function.
