        <h4>When I got blocked on a simple problem</h4>
        <p>
            I think this week I have made some reasonably simple problems challenging for myself. One of them is the 
            fizzbuzz exercise which was fairly simple to understand where multiple of three should print “fizz” and multiple of 
            five should print “buzz”. I got stuck on the first question asking to return a number. Instead of writing out the function,
             I was inputting some numbers in there (I don’t know why! :/) which is embarrassing to even write about it. I think I was at 
             a point where I felt mentally blocked and wasn’t reading the question and test codes properly to understand what it was asking.
             fter spending too much time on it, I decided to seek help from a fellow colleague in my cohort. She helped by explaining that we 
             are actually writing a function so it should work with any numbers we put in. I was just so focused on the test codes that I 
             didnt click its the function I need to write for the test codes to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Something as simple as this has definitely made me realise to read the questions properly and be more attention to detail. 
            Without understanding the problem properly, there’s no way you can solve it. 
        </p>
    
  
        <h3><u>Problem Solving Techniques</u></h3>
    
            <p>
                As we know that problem solving is one of the most important skill for developers to have.
                 Some of the problem solving techniques I used are:

            </p>
            <h4> Pseudocode </h4>
            <p>
                Pseudocode basically allows you to plan and write down steps that will lead to problem solving without
                 including all of the technical details. This is very useful for me as it helps me break down the steps and 
                 write in a way that I am familiar with.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
            <p>
                I got error messages like millions of times! This helps by giving clues, such as where in the code you’re going wrong. 
                I have found out that the solution could just be in the error messages. Something as simple as removing extra bracket
                 notation. 
            </p>
            <h4>Reflection </h4>
            <p>
                This has helped me a lot too. Taking time out to reflect on the problems or the codes I have written to 
                figure out how to make improvements and where I am going wrong. This technique has been very useful to me.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking peers for help  </h4>
            <p>
                Sometimes you need to rely on others to improve or find answers. With one of my question, I seeked help from 
                a friend which made me realise where I was going wrong instead of feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. 
            </p>
            <h4>Talk to a Rubber Duck</h4>
            <p>
                Talking to an inanimate object in your own language that you understand can help with finding answers.
                 Even though, this is not my first go to option to seek answers but I have tried it few times and I just need to 
                 get in the habit of using it more when I feel like I need to hear myself out loud.
            </p>
            <h4>Googling </h4>
            <p>
                Google has definitely been my best friend. This has helped me so much with problem solving nearly every question. 
                The best part of it is that rather than providing solution or instructions for that exact question I’m trying to solve,
                 I end up learning other things too along the way.
            </p>
            <h4>Trying something</h4>
            <p>
                When trying out codes, I often try to use what I know to make something work even if it gives me multiple error. 
                You will never know until you try out something.
            </p>
            <h4>Console.logging</h4>
            <p>
                I find it very useful using console.logging because it helps me understand and be sure how my code is flowing.
                 It helps me find out what part of my code is working and what’s not. 
            </p>
