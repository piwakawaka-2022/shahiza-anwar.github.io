    <p>This Blog will give insight into what Emotional Intelligence is 
        and how it is different to Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</p>
    <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
    <p>Emotional intelligence is having the capacity to  recognise and manage our own emotions 
as well as able to respond 
        to emotions of others too. Emotional Intelligence can be learned and developed at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
    5 Qualities of Emotional Intelligence as described by the psychologist Daniel Coleman:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Self -awareness - The first step in achieving Emotional intelligence is 
            to understand your own emotions and the effect of your actions on other people.
            To be self-aware, you must recognise your different emotional reactions. 
            This way, you will know your own strengths and limitations and also be able to
             learn by interacting with others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Self-regulation - This is the ability to manage your emotions and behaviours. 
            When you are aware of your emotions, you will be good at managing conflict and 
            maintaining calm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Empathise - Basically, putting yourself in someone else’s shoe to understand
             how they are feeling in that situation. You have to be a good listener, 
             not judgemental and understand the needs and wants of other people.
        </li>
        <li>
            Social-skills- Having this skill, you are able to have better interaction with others. 
            s way you can build meaningful relationships with others.
        </li>
        <li>
            Motivation- If you are motivated then you have the ability to motivate others.
             They are very driven towards their goal. This will help your own self and others 
             to grow, improve and succeed.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>How is it different to IQ?</h4>
    <p>
        IQ refers to an individuals intelligence, to assess a persons cognitive abilities to 
        logical problem solving. The main difference between the two is that Emotional 
        intelligence is a measure of ones ability to understands ones emotions as well as the
         emotions of others too while IQ is a measure of ones intelligence. IQ can help solve 
         problems through logical reasoning while Emotional Intelligence is about empathising 
         with others.
    </p>
    <h4>Why Is EQ important?</h4>
    <p>
        Having the ability to recognise and understand your emotions and its effect on your 
        actions, will help you live a better positive life. It is an integral part in developing 
        meaningful human relationships, effectively manage conflicts as well as able to cope with
         stress and anxiety. Knowing how to deal with our emotions can help with better 
         decision-making too and avoiding rational decisions. Emotional Intelligence is 
         important to help you both in personal and professional development.
